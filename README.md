Typing Club Bot 

This project will allow you to automate all Typing Club levels completely while getting the full score every tie. It will finish the lesson, open the new, and finish that one, repeating the cycle until all the levels are finished. To use this code, all you have to do is copy it, open the first Typing Club level, then inspect the site and open the console, paste the code, and watch the magic! Just plug in your laptop and let it run. (Make sure not to edit the speed otherwise Typing Club will not register).
